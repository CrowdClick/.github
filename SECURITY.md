# Reporting Vulnerabilities


**⚠️ Please do not file public GitHub issues for security
vulnerabilities as they are open for everyone to see! ⚠️**

We encourage responsible disclosure practices for security
vulnerabilities.

If you believe you've found a security-related bug, email
[Jakub Boukal](mailto:security@crowdclick.me)
instead of filing a ticket or posting to any public groups. We'll try to
assess the problem and disclose it in a responsible way.
